# Analysis to check for LoF mutations in sigB operon (rsbU,rsbV, rsbW, sigB)
# In the DFU metagenomes
# However, also potentially interested in other operons, so includes a step to map all reads to FPR3757, to then use
# SNPeff to annotate predicted effects of mutations by gene
# for the purposes of this analysis, sigB genes are all we're looking at 

# MetagenomicCladeEnv and JavaEnv are the conda/mamba environments used for this

# 1) Align simulated reads for other Staphylococcal species
#    found in large abundances in some of the DFU samples
#    to the sigB operon genes and run coverage_stats.py 
#    to flag gene/species combinations where the simulated
#    reads have >30X mean depth  (where mean expected depth
#    if identical is a little over 100X)

CatReads.sh # format the reads to be the same as our metagenomes
AlignSigBSimulated.sh # align and call covg stats


# 2) Align all metagenomic reads to the full JE2 
#    /LAC (GCA_000013465) genome so we can then 
#    annotate the variants w/ SNPeff

AlignFullLAC.sh

# 3) replace default GCA_000013465 chromosome names with those
#    in the snpEff pre-built database for this genome

# 4) Run snpEff to annotate the VCF files, doing one timepoint per
#    call to run a few at once
#    Using week 2 timepoint(visit 1) as the baseline since it's the
#    first timepoint post-debridement
