# DFU Metagenomic shotgun analyses
This folder contains analyses related to S. aureus strain diversity & composition in DFU (post-CellHostMicrobe paper) which specifically deals with strain detection and microbial community dynamics in the DFU100 cohort, as observed in the metagenomic shotgun sequencing obtained for Kalan et al. 2019.  
That includes:
- Dirichlet Multinomial Mixture modeling (based on Loesche et al. 2017) on the shotgun metagenomic data to classify metagenomic samples from the DFU100 into 'community types' 
- Failed attempts to identify multiclonal S. aureus samples de novo with Diatasic 
- Scripts for visualizing a reference *S. aureus* genome's coverage at each timepoint/subject combination
