# AGR-typing scripts
## Amy Campbell
This folder contains scripts I used back in February to try to assign AGR system types to the *S. aureus* isolates (pre-contig cleaning). It's an analysis I need to return to with the cleaned contigs, and eventually with the hybrid-assembled genomes, but basically trying to figure out whether a weird thing I noticed in some of the isolates is (namely, the presence of more than one marker for AGR system types).
